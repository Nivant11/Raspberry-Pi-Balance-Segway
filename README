This program will generate a PID control signal based on the angle of the sensor. The sensor that is used is the BerryIMUv3. It is intended for
use with a segway balance car. 

The program uses a complementary filter for the sensor fusion.
The code utilizes the pigpio library, which you must have installed in order to run the program.

All the components used:
Raspberry Pi 4B
BerryIMUv3
L298N Motor Driver
2x JGA25-371 Motor with encoder
12V battery pack
Portable charger (for powering the RPi)

Compile with;
gcc -o pid -l rt pid.c -lm -lpigpio

To run;
sudo ./pid
